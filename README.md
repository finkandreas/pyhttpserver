# pyhttpserver
Local HTTP server to ease my life

# Usage
This is a project to create a local server. I just wanted to implement some stuff in python and this is a toy project.
Probably nothing really works for you, but feel free to use anything. Interesting might be the DAV stuff for caldav/carddav. 
Use http://localhost:8080/dav as starting point for this.
It uses freedesktop's secret storage specification to access usernames/passwords for your accounts.
